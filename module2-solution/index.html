                    <p>
                        In regions of the world that prefer mild beverages, such as the West and Far East, green tea should be
                        steeped in water around 80 to 85 &deg;C (176 to 185 &deg;F), the higher the quality of the leaves the lower
                        the temperature. Regions such as North Africa or Central Asia prefer a bitter tea, and hotter water is used.
                        In Morocco, green tea is steeped in boiling water for 15 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The container in which green tea is steeped is often warmed beforehand to prevent premature cooling.
                        High-quality green and white teas can have new water added as many as five or more times, depending on
                        variety, at increasingly higher temperatures.

                    <p>
                        Oolong tea should be brewed around 82 to 96 &deg;C (185 to 205 &deg;F), with the brewing vessel warmed before
                        pouring the water. Yixing purple clay teapots are the traditional brewing-vessel for oolong tea
                        which can be brewed multiple times from the same leaves, unlike green tea, seeming to improve with reuse.
                        In the Chinese and Taiwanese Gongfu tea ceremony, the first brew is discarded, as it is
                        considered a rinse of leaves rather than a proper brew.

                    <h2 class="title1">Black tea</h2>
                    <p>
                        Popular varieties of black tea include Assam, Nepal, Darjeeling, Nilgiri, Turkish, Keemun, and Ceylon teas.

                    <p>
                        Many of the active substances in black tea do not develop at temperatures lower than 90 &deg;C (194 &deg;F).
                        As a result, black tea in the West is usually steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99 &deg;C
                        (210 &deg;F). The most common fault when making black tea is to use water at too low a temperature.
                        Since boiling point drops with increasing altitude, it is difficult to brew black tea properly in
                        mountainous areas. Warming the tea pot before steeping is critical at any elevation.

                    <p>
                        Western black teas are usually brewed for about four minutes and are usually not allowed to steep for
                        less than 30 seconds or more than about five minutes (a process known as brewing or mashing in Britain).
                        In many regions of the world, however, actively boiling water is used and the tea is often stewed.
                        In India, black tea is often boiled for fifteen minutes or longer to make Masala chai, as a strong
                        brew is preferred. Tea should be strained while serving.

                        A food safety management group of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published
                        a standard for preparing a cup of tea (ISO 3103: Tea â€” Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests),
                        primarily intended for standardizing preparation for comparison and rating purposes.
